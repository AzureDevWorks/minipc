# Installing Microsoft SQL Server 2022 on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)

Ubuntu 24.04 “Noble” is not yet officially supported by Microsoft SQL Server 2022, but you can use the Ubuntu 22.04 packages as a workaround. This guide will walk you through installing **SQL Server Developer Edition** on your mini PC and configuring it for local network access.

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 running on your mini PC
- SSH access to your mini PC
- Static IP setup for RJ45 direct connection (optional for local network access)

---

## Step 1: Remove Existing Microsoft GPG Keys (Optional)

Clean up any previous keys to avoid conflicts:

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg
sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/msprod.gpg
````

---

## Step 2: Import Microsoft GPG Key

```bash
sudo curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc
```

---

## Step 3: Add SQL Server 2022 Repository for Ubuntu 22.04

Since Ubuntu 24.04 isn't officially supported, we use the 22.04 repository:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/mssql-server-2022.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-server-2022.list
sudo apt update
```

---

## Step 4: Install SQL Server

```bash
sudo apt install -y mssql-server
```

---

## Step 5: Configure SQL Server

```bash
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
```

During setup:

1. Accept the license terms
2. Choose **Developer Edition** (free)
3. Set a strong `SA` password

---

## Step 6: Verify SQL Server is Running

```bash
systemctl status mssql-server
```

You should see `active (running)`.

---

## Step 7: Install SQL Server Command-Line Tools

```bash
sudo apt install -y mssql-tools unixodbc-dev
```

Add the tools to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can use `sqlcmd` from the terminal.

---

## Step 8: Test SQL Server Locally

```bash
sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'YourStrong!Passw0rd'
```

You should see the `1>` prompt for running queries.

---

## Step 9: Allow Remote Access over RJ45

1. Open the SQL Server port through the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 1433/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

2. Verify SQL Server is listening on port 1433:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 1433
```

---

## Step 10: Connect from Windows PC

You can use **Azure Data Studio** or **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**:

* **Server:** `192.168.50.2`
* **Authentication:** SQL Server Authentication
* **Login:** `SA`
* **Password:** The one you set during setup

Or via command line:

```powershell
sqlcmd -S 192.168.50.2 -U SA -P 'YourStrong!Passw0rd'
```

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **Missing Dependencies:** If you encounter errors like `libldap-common` missing:

```bash
sudo apt install libldap-common
```

* **Service Not Starting:** Check logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u mssql-server
```

---

## Conclusion

You now have **SQL Server Developer Edition running on Ubuntu 24.04**, accessible locally via RJ45. This setup allows for development, testing, and local database management even though official 24.04 support isn’t yet available.

This version is **fully compatible with GitHub Markdown**, with properly closed code blocks and clean headings.  

If you want, I can also create a **full “Mini PC Dev Environment” Markdown guide** that includes **SSH setup, SQL Server, file transfers, and optional web hosting**, ready for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
